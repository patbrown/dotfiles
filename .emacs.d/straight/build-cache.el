BODY has the format:

    (BODY-MAP BODY-KEY &rest BODY-PLIST)

DOCSTRING will be displayed in the echo area to identify the
Hydra.  When DOCSTRING starts with a newline, special Ruby-style
substitution will be performed by `hydra--format'.

Functions are created on basis of HEADS, each of which has the
format:

    (KEY CMD &optional HINT &rest PLIST)

BODY-MAP is a keymap; `global-map' is used quite often.  Each
function generated from HEADS will be bound in BODY-MAP to
BODY-KEY + KEY (both are strings passed to `kbd'), and will set
the transient map so that all following heads can be called
though KEY only.  BODY-KEY can be an empty string.

CMD is a callable expression: either an interactive function
name, or an interactive lambda, or a single sexp (it will be
wrapped in an interactive lambda).

HINT is a short string that identifies its head.  It will be
printed beside KEY in the echo erea if `hydra-is-helpful' is not
nil.  If you don't even want the KEY to be printed, set HINT
explicitly to nil.

The heads inherit their PLIST from BODY-PLIST and are allowed to
override some keys.  The keys recognized are :exit, :bind, and :column.
:exit can be:

- nil (default): this head will continue the Hydra state.
- t: this head will stop the Hydra state.

:bind can be:
- nil: this head will not be bound in BODY-MAP.
- a lambda taking KEY and CMD used to bind a head.

:column is a string that sets the column for all subsequent heads.

It is possible to omit both BODY-MAP and BODY-KEY if you don't
want to bind anything.  In that case, typically you will bind the
generated NAME/body command.  This command is also the return
result of `defhydra'.

BODY is the same as that in `defhydra', withe the following
pretty hydra specific ones:

  - `:separator' a single char used to generate the separator
    line.

  - `:title' a string that's added to the beginning of the
    docstring as a title of the hydra.

  - `:formatter' a function that takes the generated docstring

HEADS-PLIST is a plist of columns of hydra heads.  The keys of
the plist should be column names.  The values should be lists of
hydra heads.  Each head has exactly the same syntax as that of
`defhydra', except hint is required for the head to appear in the

  - `:width' the max width of a dynamic hint, used to calculate
    the final width of the entire column.  It is ignored when the
    hint is a string.

  - `:toggle' when specified, it makes the head a toggle and adds
    an indicator to the end of the hint for the status of the
    toggle.  The value of this option can be a symbol, an s-exp

       :mode 'dired-mode
       :mode-hook 'dired-mode-hook

This will bind a function named `dired-mode-turn-on-mygroup' to
the hook `dired-mode-hook' specified in :mode-hook. The name for
the function is `<foo>-turn-on-discover' where `<foo>' is the
`car' symbol in :context-menu - better known as the name of the
context menu.

The function will call `local-set-key' with the binding given
in :bind.


Example 2. Globalized Discover Support:

    (discover-add-context-menu
       :context-menu (mygroup ...)
       :bind \"C-x r\")

As above, this will bind a function but this one is called
`discover--turn-on-mygroup' and is set when `discover-mode' is
set. This enables you to create \"global\" keybindings (that
nevertheless only take effect when `discover-mode' or
`global-discover-mode' is enabled) instead of local
ones. Omitting :mode and :mode-hook is all it takes.

PList Definitions:

:context-menu is a menu definition. See `discover-context-menus'.

:mode is a major mode symbol where the key in :bind take
effect. If major mode is `nil' then the key is defined against
`discover-mode' and is thus in effect when `discover-mode' is
enabled.

:mode-hook is the name of the mode hook where the context menu
key gets bound. Usually it's `<name>-mode-hook'. This property is
redundant if :mode is nil.

:bind is a string, to be passed to `kbd', that the context menu
will be bound to.

Notes:

You can only bind one menu per call to discover. The bound name
given to the key group is taken from the `car' in the list passed
to :context-menu. You can retrieve the command symbol for the
context menu by calling `discover-get-context-menu-command-name'
with the symbol name of the context menu..

 (1) POSITION

POSITION can be:
1. An integer, meaning point position.
2. A cons of two integers, meaning absolute X and Y coordinates.
3. Other type, in which case the corresponding POSHANDLER should be
   provided.

 (2) POSHANDLER

POSHANDLER is a function of one argument returning an actual
position.  Its argument is a plist of the following form:

  (:position xxx
   :poshandler xxx
   :font-height xxx
   :font-width xxx
   :posframe xxx
   :posframe-width xxx
   :posframe-height xxx
   :posframe-buffer xxx
   :parent-frame xxx
   :parent-window-left xxx
   :parent-window-top xxx
   :parent-frame-width xxx
   :parent-frame-height xxx
   :parent-window xxx
   :parent-window-width  xxx
   :parent-window-height xxx
   :mouse-x xxx
   ;mouse-y xxx
   :minibuffer-height xxx
   :mode-line-height  xxx
   :header-line-height xxx
   :tab-line-height xxx
   :x-pixel-offset xxx
   :y-pixel-offset xxx)

By default, poshandler is auto-selected based on the type of POSITION,
but the selection can be overridden using the POSHANDLER argument.

The builtin poshandler functions are listed below:

1.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-center'
2.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-center'
3.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-corner'
4.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-right-corner'
5.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-center'
6.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-left-corner'
7.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-right-corner'
8.  `posframe-poshandler-window-center'
9.  `posframe-poshandler-window-top-center'
10. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-left-corner'
11. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-right-corner'
12. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-center'
13. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-left-corner'
14. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-right-corner'
15. `posframe-poshandler-point-top-left-corner'
16. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner'
17. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner-upward'
18. `posframe-poshandler-point-window-center'
19. `posframe-poshandler-point-frame-center'

 (3) POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO

POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO is a plist, which will prepend to the
argument of poshandler function: `info', it will *OVERRIDE* the
exist key in `info'.

 (4) BUFFER-OR-NAME

This posframe's buffer is BUFFER-OR-NAME, which can be a buffer
or a name of a (possibly nonexistent) buffer.

buffer name can prefix with space, for example \" *mybuffer*\", so
the buffer name will hide for ibuffer and `list-buffers'.

 (5) NO-PROPERTIES

If NO-PROPERTIES is non-nil, The STRING's properties will
be removed before being shown in posframe.

 (6) HEIGHT, MAX-HEIGHT, MIN-HEIGHT, WIDTH, MAX-WIDTH and MIN-WIDTH

These arguments are specified in the canonical character width
and height of posframe, more details can be found in docstring of
function `fit-frame-to-buffer',

 (7) LEFT-FRINGE and RIGHT-FRINGE

If LEFT-FRINGE or RIGHT-FRINGE is a number, left fringe or
right fringe with be shown with the specified width.

 (8) BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-COLOR, INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR

By default, posframe shows no borders, but users can specify
borders by setting BORDER-WIDTH to a positive number.  Border
color can be specified by BORDER-COLOR.

INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR are same as
BORDER-WIDTH and BORDER-COLOR, but do not suggest to use for the
reason:

   Add distinct controls for child frames' borders (Bug#45620)
   http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=ff7b1a133bfa7f2614650f8551824ffaef13fadc

 (9) FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR

Posframe's font as well as foreground and background colors are
derived from the current frame by default, but can be overridden
using the FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR arguments,
respectively.

 (10) RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE

By default, posframe will display no header-line, mode-line and
tab-line.  In case a header-line, mode-line or tab-line is
desired, users can set RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE
to t.

 (11) INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE is a function with no argument.  It will run when
posframe buffer is first selected with `with-current-buffer'
in `posframe-show', and only run once (for performance reasons).

 (12) LINES-TRUNCATE

If LINES-TRUNCATE is non-nil, then lines will truncate in the
posframe instead of wrap.

 (13) OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS

OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS is very powful, *all* the valid frame parameters
used by posframe's frame can be overridden by it.

NOTE: some `posframe-show' arguments are not frame parameters, so they
can not be overrided by this argument.

 (14) TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT can specify the number of seconds after which the posframe
will auto-hide.

 (15) REFRESH

If REFRESH is a number, posframe's frame-size will be re-adjusted
every REFRESH seconds.

 (16) ACCEPT-FOCUS

When ACCEPT-FOCUS is non-nil, posframe will accept focus.
be careful, you may face some bugs when set it to non-nil.

 (17) HIDEHANDLER

HIDEHANDLER is a function, when it return t, posframe will be
hide, this function has a plist argument:

  (:posframe-buffer xxx
   :posframe-parent-buffer xxx)

The builtin hidehandler functions are listed below:

1. `posframe-hidehandler-when-buffer-switch'

 (18) REFPOSHANDLER

REFPOSHANDLER is a function, a reference position (most is
top-left of current frame) will be returned when call this
function.

when it is nil or it return nil, child-frame feature will be used
and reference position will be deal with in Emacs.

The user case I know at the moment is let ivy-posframe work well
in EXWM environment (let posframe show on the other appliction
window).

         DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY!!!

An example parent frame poshandler function is:

1. `posframe-refposhandler-xwininfo'

 (19) Others

You can use `posframe-delete-all' to delete all posframes.
